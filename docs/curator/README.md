# Cosmos Curator Curator Docs

This directory collects documentation for the curator pipeline layer. It is organized by the dominant purpose of each document:

- **Guides** teach workflows and debugging tasks.
- **Reference** documents current behavior, APIs, output formats, and operational contracts.
- **Design** captures architecture direction, rationale, plans, and open questions.

## Guides

- [Interactive Slurm Development Guide](guides/slurm-interactive.md) - iterate from an interactive Slurm allocation.
- [Profiling Guide](guides/profiling.md) - collect and inspect CPU and memory profiles.
- [Observability Guide](guides/observability.md) - monitor pipeline health and metrics.
- [vLLM Async Captioning Guide](guides/vllm-async-captioning.md) - use the async vLLM captioning path.
- [vLLM Interface Plugin Guide](guides/vllm-interface-plugin.md) - add a new vLLM model plugin.
