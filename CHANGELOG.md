# Changelog

## Latest

## [2.1.0]

### Released

- 2026-06-05

### Breaking Changes

- Make the split-pipeline aggregate caption artifact opt-in:
  - `v0/all_window_captions.json` is no longer written by default.
  - Use `--write-all-caption-json` or `write_all_caption_json: true` to emit it.
  - Remove the old `--no-write-all-caption-json` flag.
- Change image annotate filter toggles from `enable|disable` arguments to boolean flags:
  - Use `--semantic-filter` / `--no-semantic-filter`.
  - Use `--image-classifier` / `--no-image-classifier`.
- Replace Poetry-based development and package builds with Pixi and `setuptools-scm`:
  - `poetry.lock`, Poetry dependency groups, and `poetry build` flows are removed.
  - Package versions are now derived from Git tags.
  - Use `pixi run build` or `python -m build` for wheel builds.
- Remove the redundant `transformers` Pixi environment; use `default`, `legacy-transformers`, or
  `unified` as appropriate.

### Added

- Cosmos 3 omnimodel reasoner-head support for vLLM video captioning and VLM stages, with
  `cosmos3_nano` and `cosmos3_super` variants.
- Model registry entries for `nvidia/Cosmos3-Nano`, `nvidia/Cosmos3-Super`, and
  `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5`.
- Config-driven split-output comparison tool under
  `cosmos_curator.pipelines.video.split_comparison`, including:
  - summary, per-clip metadata, aesthetic score, motion score, caption-similarity, and MP4
    `VideoIndex` comparisons;
  - Ray Data execution for metadata and video-index comparison stages;
  - JSON and Lance report output;
  - a `--print-default-config` helper for bootstrapping comparison configs.
- `cosmos-curator slurm import-image` command for importing Docker/Enroot images through Slurm,
  with remote login-node support, output naming, overwrite control, and retries.
- Image annotate config-mode and NVCF execution support, including flat YAML and nested JSON
  payloads and an `invoke_image_annotate.json` example.
- Pixi task aliases for common runtime commands: `hello-world`, `model-download`, `video-pipeline`,
  and `gputest`.
- Cross-platform `dev-hooks` Pixi environment for pre-commit hooks, plus `nvtop` and `nvitop` in the
  developer environment.
- Storage helpers for resolving `smart_open` parameters and detecting missing local/S3 objects.

### Fixed

- Upgrade `cosmos-xenna` to v0.4.3 and harden vLLM captioning recovery when actors or vLLM
  `EngineCore` subprocesses die.
- Reap orphaned vLLM `EngineCore` processes before worker setup and add a liveness watchdog so wedged
  workers can be replaced by Xenna.
- Disable worker lifetime recycling for large Cosmos 3 sync vLLM stages to avoid GPU-memory
  collisions during replacement.
- Restore the hello-world pipeline launch path after the Pixi task and environment changes.
- Support image annotate in NVCF asset handling and presigned input/output ZIP workflows.
- Avoid rebuilding and uploading aggregate split-caption metadata for presigned outputs unless
  `write_all_caption_json` is enabled.

  environments.
- Run the NVCF split benchmark as a package module so repository-root imports work correctly.
- Allow newer Click versions after the broken Click 8.3 pin was removed.
- Remove extra OpenCV runtime dependencies.

### Changed

- Build full Docker images with source-built PyAV/OpenCV wheels linked against the project FFmpeg,
  and patch the runtime Pixi lockfile to use those local wheels.
- Move package metadata to dynamic `setuptools-scm` versioning and add CI version-resolution jobs
  that fetch Git tags before builds.
