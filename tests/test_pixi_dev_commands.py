"""Validate the developer command contract.

These tests are structural guards for the Pixi developer commands rather than
substitutes for running the commands themselves. They verify that:

- Pixi dev `ruff` and `mypy` versions stay aligned with Poetry dev pins, which
  prevents drift between `pixi.toml` and `pyproject.toml`.
- Pixi carries the pytest plugins required by local CPU test commands.
- The Pixi `dev` feature stays isolated from runtime environments and image
  defaults so lint tooling is not installed in production containers.
- The developer guide documents the supported command entry points.
