            "the animation.\n"
            "*   **00:07 - 00:09 (The Elder):** The scene cuts to a dimly lit interior, likely a cave or a rustic "
            "hut. We see a close-up of an older man with a weathered face, a thick grey beard, and a headband "
            "adorned with metal rings. He has distinctive piercings in his nose and cheeks. The lighting here is "

            "opening scene. He appears to be speaking or listening intently.\n"

            "first scene (Sintel). She is now inside the same warm environment. Her expression is one of concern, "
            "worry, or perhaps sadness. Her mouth is slightly open as if she is about to speak or has just heard "
