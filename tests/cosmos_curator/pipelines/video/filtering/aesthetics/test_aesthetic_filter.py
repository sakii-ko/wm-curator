"""Functional test for aesthetic score filtering stages.

This test verifies the aesthetic scoring and filtering stages using a sample video.
The expected aesthetic score values were obtained by running the aesthetic filter pipeline
on the sample video (ForBiggerBlazes.mp4) and capturing the actual values produced.
These values serve as a regression test to ensure the aesthetic scoring algorithm
maintains consistency across code changes.
