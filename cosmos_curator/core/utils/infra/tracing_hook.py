"""Ray tracing hook and driver-side tracing setup.

This module contains the **Ray-specific** tracing integration:

Driver side (called from ``profiling_scope()``):
    :func:`enable_tracing` -- sets environment variables and
    pre-initializes the driver with OTel, so that
    ``init_or_connect_to_cluster()`` passes the hook to ``ray.init()``.

Worker side (called automatically by Ray):
    :func:`setup_tracing` -- configures an OpenTelemetry
    ``TracerProvider`` with a ``ConsoleSpanExporter`` that writes
    NDJSON span data (one JSON object per line) to a local file
    under the staging directory.  An ``atexit`` handler flushes
    the provider to ensure all spans reach disk.  Post-pipeline,
    ``ArtifactDelivery`` collects staged trace files from
    all nodes.

The **generic span API** (:class:`TracedSpan`, :func:`traced_span`,
:func:`traced`, ``StatusCode``) lives in :mod:`tracing`.

Configuration is passed via environment variables because the Ray
hook function signature takes no arguments:

    COSMOS_CURATOR_ARTIFACTS_STAGING_DIR
        Local staging directory where all profiling artifacts
        (including traces) are written.  Trace files go to
        ``<staging_dir>/traces/``.  Set by
        ``ArtifactDelivery``
        before the pipeline starts.

    COSMOS_CURATOR_TRACE_DIR
        Local directory where span files are written.  When
        ``COSMOS_CURATOR_ARTIFACTS_STAGING_DIR`` is set, this defaults to
        ``<staging_dir>/traces/``.  Otherwise defaults to
        ``/tmp/cosmos_curator_traces``.

    OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT  *(standard OTel env var)*
        OTLP HTTP endpoint for remote span export.  **Opt-in**:
        when neither this nor ``OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT``
        is set, remote OTLP export is disabled and spans are only
        written to local ``.jsonl`` files.  Set to a collector URL
        (e.g. ``http://localhost:4318``) to enable remote delivery.
        Can also be set via ``--profile-tracing-otlp-endpoint``.

    OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT  *(standard OTel env var)*
        Trace-specific override for ``OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT``.
        Takes precedence when both are set.

    OTEL_SERVICE_NAME  *(standard OTel env var)*
        Overrides the ``service.name`` resource attribute attached
        to the ``TracerProvider``.  Default: ``cosmos_curator``.
        Visible as the "service name" column in Jaeger, Grafana
        Tempo, and other tracing backends.

    The ``OTLPSpanExporter`` also honours additional standard OTel
    env vars (``OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS``,
    ``OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TIMEOUT``, ``OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_CERTIFICATE``,
    etc.) -- see the `OTel specification`_ for the full list.

    .. _OTel specification:
       https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/protocol/exporter/

The hook is referenced as a ``"module:attribute"`` string::

    ray.init(
        _tracing_startup_hook=(
            "cosmos_curator.core.utils.infra.tracing_hook:setup_tracing"
        ),
        ...
    )

Ray stores this string in its GCS internal KV store and every
worker (including the driver) reads it on startup, so the function
must be importable on all nodes.

Library auto-instrumentation
----------------------------
When tracing is enabled, ``setup_tracing()`` also activates OTel
auto-instrumentors for commonly used libraries.  Each instrumentor
monkey-patches its target library to emit spans automatically:

* **botocore** -- spans for every S3 / AWS API call.
* **requests** -- spans for outbound HTTP requests.
* **urllib3** -- spans for low-level HTTP transport.
* **threading** -- propagates trace context across threads.
* **logging** -- injects ``otelTraceID`` / ``otelSpanID`` into
  stdlib ``logging.LogRecord`` attributes.
* **sqlalchemy** -- spans for SQL queries.
* **fastapi** -- spans for inbound HTTP endpoints (NVCF).

Instrumentors are gated on ``importlib.util.find_spec()`` so they
only activate when the target library is installed in the current
Pixi environment.  No errors are raised for missing libraries.

    Encapsulates all environment-variable parsing into a single typed
    object with sensible defaults.  Two construction paths:

    * **Driver side**: ``enable_tracing()`` builds a ``TracingConfig``
      from environment variables, sets the trace dir env var, then
      calls ``setup_tracing()`` on the driver.
    * **Worker side**: ``setup_tracing()`` (Ray hook, no arguments)
      calls ``TracingConfig.from_env()`` which reads the env vars.

    """Wrapper around ``OTLPSpanExporter`` that suppresses connection errors.

    When the OTLP collector (e.g. Jaeger, Grafana Tempo) is not
    reachable, the ``OTLPSpanExporter`` raises ``ConnectionError`` on
    every ``export()`` call.  With ``SimpleSpanProcessor`` this fires
    synchronously on every span end, flooding logs with full tracebacks
    via ``logger.exception()`` inside the processor.

    This wrapper catches the first connection failure, logs a single
    warning, and disables all subsequent export attempts for this
    process.  The file-based exporter (which always works) is
    unaffected, so no span data is lost -- only the real-time OTLP
    delivery is skipped.

    Design decisions:
        - Fail-open: tracing must never crash the pipeline.
          Connection failures are expected when no collector is
          deployed (e.g. local development, CI without Jaeger).
        - Log once: a single warning is sufficient for operators to
          know that OTLP delivery is not working.  Per-span
          tracebacks are noise.
        - No retry: the exporter is disabled permanently for this
          process lifetime.  A transient blip that resolves mid-run
          will not be recovered, but the file exporter captures all
          spans regardless.  Re-enabling would add complexity with
          minimal benefit (typical runs are minutes, not hours).
        - SUCCESS return: returning FAILURE would trigger SDK retry
          logic in BatchSpanProcessor (though we use
          SimpleSpanProcessor which doesn't retry).  Returning
          SUCCESS keeps the contract simple.

              |                       file stays OPEN so late spans
              v                       can still be exported

                                      THEN close file + log stats

    ``flush()`` pushes buffered span data to the OS kernel without
    closing the file handle.  Late-arriving spans (e.g. from async
    operations that fail after teardown begins) can still be written
    by the ``ConsoleSpanExporter`` because the file remains open.

    ``shutdown()`` first disables the provider (sets
    ``SimpleSpanProcessor.done = True`` so ``on_end()`` stops
    exporting), **then** closes the file handle.  This ordering
    guarantees the file is never closed while exports can still
    occur.

    Both methods are naturally idempotent: ``force_flush()`` and
    ``file.flush()`` are safe to call repeatedly, and
    ``provider.shutdown()`` / ``close_file_handle()`` have their
    own internal guards.

    If ``setup_provider()`` raises, neither ``flush()`` nor
    ``shutdown()`` will ever be called (the backend is not stored
    as the module singleton and no ``atexit`` handler is registered).
    The caller (``setup_tracing()``) is responsible for closing
    ``_file_handle`` in the failure path to prevent a file descriptor
    leak.

        _config: Frozen tracing configuration.
        _filepath: Local path to the ``.jsonl`` span file.

    Called explicitly from ``_ProfiledStage.destroy()`` and the
    exception path in ``_ProfilingState.scope()`` to push span data
    to the OS kernel **before** Ray kills the worker process.

    The file handle stays **open** so that late-arriving spans
    (e.g. from async operations failing during teardown) can still
    be exported by the ``ConsoleSpanExporter``.

    Only ``shutdown()`` (via ``atexit``) closes the file, and only
    after disabling the ``TracerProvider`` so no more exports can
    occur.
